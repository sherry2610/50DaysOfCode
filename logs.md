# 50 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: spent the day in exploring the array 101 content of leetcode. I've done some example practice on sandbox and will Start properly coding in this repo from tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** The content on leetcode is very conceptual and I enjoyed reading it and spending a lot of time thinking about.
